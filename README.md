Here I have used a PDF which has the information about Tamilnadu engineering colleges couselling.

This program helps to find the information about a particular college based on the District wise,college wise and sorted based on MQSP.
Example: 
<p>fetch_college("KGISL")<p>
output:
<p>----------<p>
<p>COLLEGE WISE           Surrender    MQ  total MQSP<p>
<p>----------
<p>KGISL             GRAND --   98    168    480  58.3<p>
<p>KGISL             CSE-L --   72    105    300  68.6<p>
